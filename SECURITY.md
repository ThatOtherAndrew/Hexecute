# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Hexecute is maintained on a **rolling release basis** where only the latest release version is officially supported. Bugfixes and security patches **will not** be backported to previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report issues and vulnerabilities by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/ThatOtherAndrew/Hexecute/issues/new) on the repository, unless there is sensitive content where public disclosure of the issue is risky. In such cases, please use the contact method(s) listed in the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) instead.
